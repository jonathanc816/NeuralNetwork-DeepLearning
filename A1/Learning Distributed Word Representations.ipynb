        "  2. (1.5) We added a gradient checker function using finite difference called `check_GloVe_gradients()`. You can run the specified cell in the notebook to check your gradient implementation for both the symmetric and asymmetric models before moving forward. \n",

The co-occurrence matrix can be *symmetric* (i.e., $X_{ij} = X_{ji}$) if the order of the words do not matter, or *asymmetric* (i.e., $X_{ij} \\neq X_{ji}$) if we wish to distinguish the counts for when $i$-th word appears before $j$-th word. \n",

        "   Word embedding models such as GloVe attempt to learn a vector space where semantically similar words are clustered close together. However, they have been shown to learn problematic associations, e.g. by embedding \"man\" more closely to \"doctor\" than \"woman\" (and vice versa for \"nurse\"). To detect such biases in word embeddings, [\"Semantics derived automatically from language corpora contain human-like biases\"](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aal4230) introduced the Word Embedding Association Test (WEAT). The WEAT test measures whether two _target_ word sets (e.g., {programmer, engineer, scientist, ...} and {nurse, teacher, librarian, ...}) have the same relative association to two _attribute_ word sets (e.g., man, male, ... and woman, female ...).\n",

        "<br />Looking at the equation above, $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{logX_{ii}}}$ term resembles the target word and $(\\frac{logX_{ij}}{\\sqrt{logX_{jj}}}-\\frac{logX_{ik}}{\\sqrt{logX_{kk}}})$ can be seen as the two attributes. Now, the question comes down to what happen when $X_{ij}$ (the number of times word i and word j co-occured together in the training corpus) is similar to $X_{ik}$  (the number of times word i and word k co-occured together in the training corpus). In a situation where the weight of one attribute ($logX_{ij}$) is really close to the other one ($logX_{ik}$), we will have to account for the denominator of each attribute, which are $logX_{jj}$ and $logX_{kk}$ respectively. Here, the ratio given by the faction from each attribute term tells us how common the word is in the corpus, which the resulting WEAT association score will be less bias.  "
